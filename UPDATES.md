# Ember — update log

## 2026-07-03

### Full v1 feature build
- `ember` schema live on shared Supabase (5 tables, RLS, private storage bucket) + `ember`
  added to PostgREST exposed schemas; advisor warning on trigger search_path fixed.
- Pantry: equipment/skill onboarding, manual CRUD, camera photo → Gemini vision → confirm sheet.
- Suggestions (`/api/suggest`) + full structured recipe generation (`/api/recipe`) via
  Claude Sonnet 5 `generateObject`; suggestion cards with match/substitution badges.
- Cook mode: one-step-per-screen UI, heat badges, watch-for cues, per-step timers, wake lock,
  session persistence/resume, streaming chat (`/api/cook`) with `amend_recipe` tool that
  rewrites remaining steps live.
- Voice: push-to-talk (MediaRecorder → Groq Whisper `/api/transcribe`) + spoken replies via
  speechSynthesis with mute toggle. NOTE: GROQ_API_KEY not found locally — endpoint returns 503
  until the key is added to `.env.local`.
- Explore: cached Claude-generated dish grid with per-user pantry diff → same recipe/cook flow;
  added insert policy for authenticated on `ember.explore_dishes`.
- Switched dev/build to webpack (`--webpack`): Windows Application Control blocks the native
  Turbopack binary on this machine.

### Scaffold (session start)
- Created project: Next.js 16 (App Router, TS) PWA + Supabase (`ember` schema in shared
  project) + Vercel AI SDK (Claude brain, Gemini vision, Groq Whisper voice).
- Brand system in `globals.css` (charcoal/ember/cream, Fraunces + Outfit), PWA manifest,
  tab-bar shell, email-OTP login, `proxy.ts` auth gate (Next 16 middleware replacement).
